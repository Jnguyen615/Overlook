# Overlook 

### Abstract 
- I built a room booking website using GET and POSt from an API server. The site allows user to book rooms, see their past and upcoming bookings and filter by room type. 

### Context
- I am currently in Mod 2 at Turing School of Software and design. It is a seven month bootcamp and I am currenlty learning front end. 

### Technologies Used 
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
- Mocha/chai for testing
- Webpack
- Github

### Installation Instructions 
In order for this application to function, it will require accessing both our backend server repository as well as our front-end repository.

### Client Side Server Setup 

-Fork the  [backend repoository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api) here
-Clone it to your local machine using the command: git clone git@github. com:turingschool-examples/overlook-api.git.
- Run the command: cd overlook-api
- Run the command: npm install
- Run the command: npm start

### Client app Setup 
- Open a separate tab in your terminal using command T
- Fork the [frontend repository]('https://github.com/Jnguyen615/Overlook') here
- Clone it to your local machine using the command: git clone git@github.com:Jnguyen615/Overlook.git
- Run the command: cd overlook-project
- Run the command: npm install
- Run the command: npm start
- Once the modules have finished compiling, enter http://localhost:8080/ into your browser to see the live web page.

### Learning Goals
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation 
- create a clear and accessible user interface 
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Implement a testing suite using TDD
- Write dry, reusable code that follows single responsibility principle 

### Wins 
- Getting the data in successfully.
- Not taking up too much time on CSS - display:grid is amazing 

### Challenges
- I have discovered things I need to work on while doing this project, like architecture 
- I struggled with the POST request and getting it to display on my page, which had a lot to do with how my app is set up. I learned a lot about different ways fetches and posts can be handled though and am happy I have it set up the way I do for now. I thought it was working but upon rechecking after the due time, it wasn't working as expected. 
- I struggled with time on this project, I spent all hours of the day for days on it and just kept encountering new bugs which I had to fix before moving on. 
- Error messages - while they were working, I realized they indeed were not working in the end. 

### Hopes 
- I plan to finish this project out, with the proper filtering of the room types. I also need to go back and check accessibility and make it up to standards.
- I'd like to implement a date picker for the calendar
- I'd like to have a vertical scrolling bar
- I'd like to do a counter - where on login the numbers for the total cost go up. 
- Better styling - I'd like to revamp the styling. 
- Overall I have a lot of improvements I'd liek to make to the app!
